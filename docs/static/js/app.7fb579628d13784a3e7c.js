After hours of struggling, I finally realized the Twitter API wouldn't let you change the text-data within the tweet button after it loaded.</p><p>In order to fix that, I had to use a function they mention in the docs called createShareButton. Now, every time the user clicks the button \"Get Success Story\", a new tweet button is generated with the link inside. This solved my problem and made it possible to have a button for the user to tweet the story.</p><p>The other problem I ran into was generating the same story twice in a row.

This also allowed the user to get all the stories at least once before seeing the same story again.</p>",learned:'<p>I learned how to use the Twitter API and how to write a "getter" function.
